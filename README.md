# Bloglist frontend

In this exercise, we will now create a frontend for the bloglist backend was created in the part 3 & 4 of fullstackopen2022.If you have not done the previous parts, i would suggest you do them first.

A login functionnality is implemented to restricting the possibility to view and create blogs, except by authenticated users. We assume that a user already exists with the good credentials.

Since the objective of this part is to test the react app, unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests with cypress are also implemented.

## To Start the application locally

To start an application:
```bash
# First, you need to start the backend, to do so, head to the part4. Everything is explained in the course

# Install dependancies
$ npm install

# To Start the frontend application
$ npm start
```
You app should be running http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
